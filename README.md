iOS project is developed via the classic MVC mode, while introducing Functional and Reactive Cocoa programming ideas.

Overall module division

1.Resource module    

    Internationalized design is adopted to make it adaptive to different languages and cell phones 
    of different countries, meanwhile,resource dynamic program is able to get the latest resource 
    allocation from the server, then update and display that in cell phone APPwithout reinstallation

4.Memory modules

    There is a combination of encrypted database, general database, serialization and key string storage,

    specific usage scenario. The storage part is deeply encapsulated for easy invocation and debugging.

5.Account module
